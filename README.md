# Math220 Computational Projects

This repository contains computational mathematics projects developed as part of **Math 220** coursework.  
The work explores mathematical concepts using Python, numerical methods, and visualization techniques.

The project is provided in two formats:
- A **Jupyter Notebook** for interactive exploration
- An **executable Python script** for reproducibility and command-line execution
